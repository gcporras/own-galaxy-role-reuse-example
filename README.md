# Own-Galaxy-Role-Reuse-Example

This is an example of the use of [librarian-ansible](https://github.com/bcoe/librarian-ansible) to install and reuse
roles defined outside [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com). In this example the external role is installed
from a private [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com) repository.
